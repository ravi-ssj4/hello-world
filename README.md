# hello-world
just learning git for the first time..

Lately, I have been thinking that love is just a distraction. If u love someone, they won't love u back and when u don't love someone, then they surprisingly love u.. its so counter-intuitive !! Human beings are so weird and twisted on so many levels. The creater really had a dark sense of humour while creating us I think. Well, from my experience, I'd say that we should just keep on focussing on our own passion and moving forward and that passion shouldn't be love :P
